We adapt the James–Stein shrinkage method to propose estimators that are no worse and are oftentimes better in the prediction mean squared error after information integration, regardless of the degree of study population heterogeneity. We conduct comprehensive simulation studies to investigate the numerical performance of the proposed estimators. We also apply the method to enhance a prediction model for patella bone lead level in terms of blood lead level and other covariates by integrating summary information from published literature.
