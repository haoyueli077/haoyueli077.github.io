Hi! I am Haoyue Li, a third year PhD student from the [Department of Statistics](https://science.psu.edu/stat) at Pennsylvania State University, advised by Dr. [Runze Li](https://science.psu.edu/stat/people/ril4). Prior to Penn State, I earned my M.S. in Biostatistics from University of Michigan, where I worked closely with Dr. [Peisong Han](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/han-peisong.html) and Dr. [Jeremy Taylor](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/taylor-jeremy.html). I completed a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics with a minor in Applied Mathematics at Nankai University.

My research mainly focuses on statistical methodology for data integration problems. In particular, I am interested in transfer learning, shrinkage methods, high dimensional statistics and causal inference.
